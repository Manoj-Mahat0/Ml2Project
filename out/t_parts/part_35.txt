
The WineQualityClustering class has three key methods:

    The fit method trains the K-Means model and assigns a cluster to each wine sample.
    The predict method predicts the cluster for new, unseen data.
    The evaluate method evaluates the clustering modelâ€™s performance using metrics like accuracy and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
