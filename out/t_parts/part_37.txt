
The fit method also includes a process where we compare the predicted clusters to the actual quality labels and create the best possible mapping between them using a function called label_permute_compare.


Now, letâ€™s move on to the first part of the experiment, where we initialize the WineQualityClustering class with 100 clusters, fit the model to the training data, and evaluate its performance on both the training and testing datasets.
