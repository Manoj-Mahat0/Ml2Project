
However, there’s always room for improvement in data preprocessing. For instance, we could explore feature engineering to create new variables or remove features that don’t contribute meaningfully to the model. Additionally, we could handle imbalanced classes if needed, although the wine quality variable appeared fairly balanced.


Looking forward, there are several avenues for further work. For example, we could experiment with more complex models, such as deep learning techniques, which might better capture the intricate relationships between features and wine quality.
