    Fixed acidity
    Volatile acidity
    Citric acid
    Residual sugar
    Chlorides
    Free sulfur dioxide
    Total sulfur dioxide
    Density
    pH
    Sulphates
    Alcohol

Additionally, there is a target variable called quality, which is an integer representing the wine quality score ranging from 3 to 9.
