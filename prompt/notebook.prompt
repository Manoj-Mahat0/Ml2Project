------------------------- DATASET DESCRIPTION -------------------------



Two datasets are included, related to red and white vinho verde wine samples, from the north of Portugal. The goal is to model wine quality based on physicochemical tests (see [Cortez et al., 2009], http://www3.dsi.uminho.pt/pcortez/wine/).

Dataset Information

Additional Information

The two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. For more details, consult: http://www.vinhoverde.pt/en/ or the reference [Cortez et al., 2009].  Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).

These datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks.  The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are many more normal wines than excellent or poor ones). Outlier detection algorithms could be used to detect the few excellent or poor wines. Also, we are not sure if all input variables are relevant. So it could be interesting to test feature selection methods.

------------------------- TASK -------------------------

write a python source file to be formatted as jupyter notebook
by differentiating cells with "### CELL\n" delimiter
file paths and other key constants should be variables

the script should run a clustering algorithm to the dataset
then it should greedily map cluster number to quality score by frequency in the training set.
this model should be in a class
the run analysis on the performance of the model with printing of confusion matrix

the script should thoroughly address each part of rubric for highest score
